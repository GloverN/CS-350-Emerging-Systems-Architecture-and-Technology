# Portfolio Reflection
The final project was to code a smart thermostat. It had two buttons to allow the user to set the desired temperature and if the set temp was higher than room temperature (detected by the onboard temp sensor) the board would light up an led to simulate turning on a heater.
I think I handled the code for all the required behaviors very well. The code I wrote was well commented and modularized so that the system was readable and maintanable.
I could improve on some of the efficiency of the system, while the code is easily readable, there are some parts that are less efficient to ensure that. I could have compromised on the readability a little bit to make the code more efficient.
The skills I used in this project are absolutely transferable to other projects involving embedded systems. I learned a lot in this course and I think the most important thing was how to create and translate a state machine. It made time-based code much easier to wrap my head around and I'll probably use it often in the future.
I made this project maintainable, readable, and adaptable by making sure all of my code was commented thoroughly and modular.
